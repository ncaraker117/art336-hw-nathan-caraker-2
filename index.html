        <h3>History</h3>
        <p>Helvetica was developed in 1957 by Max Miedinger with Eduard Hoffmann at the Haas'sche Schriftgiesserei (Haas Type Foundry) of Münchenstein, Switzerland. Haas set out to design a new sans-serif typeface that could compete with the successful <em>Akzidenz-Grotesk</em> in the Swiss market. Originally called <em>Neue Haas Grotesk</em>, its design was based on <em>Schelter-Grotesk</em> and Haas' <em>Normal Grotesk</em>. The aim of the new design was to create a neutral typeface that had great clarity, no intrinsic meaning in its form, and could be used on a wide variety of signage.</p>
        <p>When Linotype adopted <em>Neue Haas Grotesk</em> (which was never planned to be a full range of mechanical and hot-metal typefaces) its design was reworked. After the success of <em>Univers</em>, Arthur Ritzel of Stempel redesigned <em>Neue Haas Grotesk</em> into a larger family.</p>
        <p>In 1960, the typeface's name was changed by Haas' German parent company Stempel to <em><big>Helvetica</big></em> (meaning Swiss in Latin) in order to make it more marketable internationally. The word's origins come from a derivative of the Swiss goddess, Helvetia. She is the national personification of the Swiss Confederation (Confoederatio Helvetica), similar Britannia in the United Kingdom, Marianne in France and historically Columbia in the United States. Helvetia's figure is used on Swiss government documents and currency. "CH" is often used as an abbreviation for "Switzerland".</p>
        
        <h3>Characteristics</h3>
        <ul>   
	           <li>tall x-height, which makes it easier to read in smaller sizes.</li>
	           <li>two-storied a (with curves of bowl and of stem).</li>
               <li>narrow t and f.</li>
	           <li>square-looking s.</li>

        <h3>Similar typefaces</h3>


        <p>Generic versions of Helvetica have been made by various vendors, including Monotype Imaging (CG Triumvirate),ParaType (Pragmatica), Bitstream (Swiss 721), URW++ (Nimbus Sans), and Ray Larabie (Coolvetica).</p>

        <p>Monotype's Arial, designed in 1982, while different from Helvetica in some few details, has identical character widths, and is indistinguishable by most non-specialists. The characters C, G, R, Q, 1, a, e, r, and t are useful for quickly distinguishing Arial and Helvetica. Differences include:</p>
            <div>
            <p>
            <small>
                <ul>
                    <li>Helvetica's strokes are typically cut either horizontally or vertically. This is especially visible in the t, r, f, and C. Arial employs slanted stroke cuts.</li>
                    <li>Helvetica's G has a well-defined spur; Arial does not.</li>
                    <li>The tail of Helvetica's R is more upright whereas Arial's R is more diagonal.</li>
                    <li>The number 1 of Helvetica has a square angle underneath the upper spur, Arial has a curve.</li>
                    <li>The Q glyph in Helvetica has a straight cross mark, while the cross mark in Arial has a slight snake-like curve.</li>
                </ul>
            </small>    
            </p>
            </div>
<p><h4>Two typefaces...</h4> with features intermediate between Arial and Helvetica are "Arimo" and "Roboto", both of which are available as web fonts. Arimo is a Croscore font family and is metrically compatible with Arial. Roboto was developed by Google for version 4 of its Android operating system.</p>
<p>"Helv", later known as "MS Sans Serif", is a sans-serif typeface that shares many key characteristics to Helvetica, including the horizontally and vertically aligned stroke terminators and more-uniform stroke widths within a glyph.</p>
        
        <h3>Usage</h3>
            <p>Helvetica is among the most widely used sans-serif typefaces. Versions exist for many alphabets and scripts.
Helvetica is a popular choice for commercial wordmarks.</p>

        <h3>Media coverage</h3>
            <p>In 2007, Linotype GmbH held the Helvetica NOW Poster Contest to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the typeface.Winners were announced in January 2008 issue of the LinoLetter.</p>
            <p>In 2007, director Gary Hustwit released a documentary film, Helvetica (Plexifilm, DVD), to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the typeface. In the film, graphic designer Wim Crouwel said, "Helvetica was a real step from the 19th century typeface... We were impressed by that because it was more neutral, and neutralism was a word that we loved. It should be neutral. It shouldn't have a meaning in itself. The meaning is in the content of the text and not in the typeface." The documentary also presented other designers who associated Helvetica with authority and corporate dominance, and whose rebellion from Helvetica's ubiquity created new styles.</p>
            <p>From April 2007 to March 2008, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City displayed an exhibit called "50 Years of Helvetica", which celebrated the many uses of the typeface. In 2011 the Disseny Hub Barcelona displayed an exhibit calledHelvetica. A New Typeface?. The exhibition included a timeline of Helvetica’s consolidation over the last fifty years with a view to understanding its role in the history of design, as well as its antecedents and its subsequent influence. The itinerary started out with a selection of local works, highlighting the top-quality design of current and past creations whose common denominator is their use of Helvetica.</p>
            <p>In 2011, one of Google's April Fools' Day jokes centered around the use of Helvetica. If a user attempted to search for the term "Helvetica" using the search engine the results would be displayed in the font Comic Sans.</p>
